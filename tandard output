       Use ‚Äúlynx -help‚Äù to display a complete list of current options.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mLynx[24m  is  a  fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running cursor-addressable, character-cell display
       devices (e.g., vt100 terminals, vt100 emulators running on Windows or any POSIX  platform,  or  any  other  ‚Äúcurses-
       oriented‚Äù  display).   It will display hypertext markup language (HTML) documents containing links to files residing
       on the local system, as well as files residing on remote systems running Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS, and NNTP servers.

       [4mLynx[24m has been ported to many systems, including all variants of Unix, Windows (since  Windows  95),  DOS  DJGPP  and
       OS/2, as well as VMS and OS/390.

       [4mLynx[24m can be used to access information on the World Wide Web, or to build information systems intended primarily for
       local  access.   For  example,  [4mLynx[24m  has  been  used  to  build several Campus Wide Information Systems (CWIS).  In
       addition, [4mLynx[24m can be used to build systems isolated within a single LAN.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       At start up, [4mLynx[24m will load any local file or remote URL specified at the command line.  For help with  URLs,  press
       ‚Äú[1m?[22m‚Äù  or ‚Äú[1mH[22m‚Äù while running [4mLynx[24m.  Then follow the link titled, ‚ÄúHelp on URLs.‚Äù

       If more than one local file or remote URL is listed on the command line, [4mLynx[24m will open only the last interactively.
       All of the names (local files and remote URLs) are added to the [1mG)oto [22mhistory.

       [4mLynx[24m  uses only long option names.  Option names can begin with double dash ‚Äú--‚Äù as well, underscores and dashes can
       be intermixed in option names (in the reference below, options are shown with one dash ‚Äú-‚Äù  before  them,  and  with
       underscores ‚Äú_‚Äù).

       [4mLynx[24m provides many command-line options.  Some options require a value (string, number or keyword).  These are noted
       in  the  reference  below.   The  other options set boolean values in the program.  There are three types of boolean
       options: set, unset and toggle.  If no option value is given, these have the obvious meaning: set (to  true),  unset
       (to  false), or toggle (between true/false).  For any of these, an explicit value can be given in different forms to
       allow for operating system constraints, e.g.,

           [1m-center:off[0m
           [1m-center=off[0m
           [1m-center-[0m

       [4mLynx[24m recognizes ‚Äú1‚Äù, ‚Äú+‚Äù, ‚Äúon‚Äù and ‚Äútrue‚Äù for true values, and ‚Äú0‚Äù, ‚Äú-‚Äù, ‚Äúoff‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse‚Äù for false values.   Other
       option-values are ignored.

       The  default  boolean, number and string option values that are compiled into [4mLynx[24m are displayed in the help-message
       provided by [1mlynx -help[22m.  Some of those may differ according to how [4mLynx[24m was built; see the help message  itself  for
       these  values.   The  [1m-help  [22moption is processed in the third pass of options-processing, so any option which sets a
       value, as well as runtime configuration values are reflected in the help-message.

       [1m-      [22mIf the argument is only ‚Äú-‚Äù, then [4mLynx[24m expects to receive the arguments from the standard input.  This is  to
              allow  for  the  potentially  very  long command line that can be associated with the [1m-get_data [22mor [1m-post_data[0m
              arguments (see below).  It can also be used to avoid having sensitive information  in  the  invoking  command
              line (which would be visible to other processes on most systems), especially when the [1m-auth [22mor [1m-pauth [22moptions
              are used.

       [1m-accept_all_cookies[0m
              accept all cookies.

       [1m-anonymous[0m
              apply restrictions for anonymous account, see also [1m-restrictions[22m.

       [1m-assume_charset[22m=[4mMIMEname[0m
              charset for documents that do not specify it.

       [1m-assume_local_charset[22m=[4mMIMEname[0m
              charset assumed for local files, i.e., files which [4mLynx[24m creates such as internal pages for the options menu.

       [1m-assume_unrec_charset[22m=[4mMIMEname[0m
              use this instead of unrecognized charsets.

       [1m-auth[22m=[4mID[24m:[4mPASSWD[0m
              set  authorization  ID  and password for protected documents at startup.  Be sure to protect any script files
              which use this switch.

       [1m-base  [22mprepend a request URL comment and BASE tag to text/html outputs for [1m-source [22mdumps.

       [1m-bibhost[22m=[4mURL[0m
              specify a local bibp server (default http://bibhost/).

       [1m-blink [22mforces high intensity background colors for color mode, if available and supported  by  the  terminal.   This
              applies to the [1mslang [22mlibrary (for a few terminal emulators), or to OS/2 EMX with [1mncurses[22m.

       [1m-book  [22muse  the  bookmark  page  as  the startfile.  The default or command line startfile is still set for the Main
              screen command, and will be used if the bookmark page is unavailable or blank.

       [1m-buried_news[0m
              toggles scanning of news articles for buried references, and converts them to news  links.   Not  recommended
              because  email  addresses  enclosed  in  angle  brackets will be converted to false news links, and uuencoded
              messages can be trashed.

       [1m-cache[22m=[4mNUMBER[0m
              set the NUMBER of documents cached in memory.  The default is 10.

       [1m-case  [22menable case-sensitive string searching.

       [1m-center[0m
              toggles center alignment in HTML TABLE.  Normally table cells are centered  on  the  table  grid.   Set  this
              option ‚Äúon‚Äù to disable centering.  The default is ‚Äúoff‚Äù.

       [1m-cfg[22m=[4mFILENAME[0m
              specifies a [4mLynx[24m configuration file other than the default lynx.cfg.

       [1m-child [22mexit on left-arrow in startfile, and disable save to disk and associated print/mail options.

       [1m-child_relaxed[0m
              exit on left-arrow in startfile, but allow save to disk and associated print/mail options.

       [1m-cmd_log[22m=[4mFILENAME[0m
              write keystroke commands and related information to the specified file.

       [1m-cmd_script[22m=[4mFILENAME[0m
              read  keystroke  commands  from  the specified file.  You can use the data written using the [1m-cmd_log [22moption.
              [4mLynx[24m will ignore other information which the command-logging may have written to the logfile.  Each  line  of
              the command script contains either a comment beginning with ‚Äú#‚Äù, or a keyword:

              [1mexit[0m
                 causes the script to stop, and forces [4mLynx[24m to exit immediately.

              [1mkey[0m
                 the  character  value,  in  printable form.  Cursor and other special keys are given as names, e.g., ‚ÄúDown
                 Arrow‚Äù.  Printable 7-bit ASCII codes are given as-is, and hexadecimal values represent other 8-bit codes.

              [1mset[0m
                 followed by a ‚Äúname=value‚Äù allows one to override values set in the lynx.cfg or .lynxrc files.  [4mLynx[24m tries
                 the cfg-file setting first.

       [1m-collapse_br_tags[0m
              toggles collapsing of BR tags.

       [1m-color [22mforces color mode on, if available.  Default color control sequences which work for many terminal  types  are
              assumed  if  the  terminal  capability  description  does  not specify how to handle color.  [4mLynx[24m needs to be
              compiled with the [1mslang [22mlibrary for this  flag,  it  is  equivalent  to  setting  the  [1mCOLORTERM  [22menvironment
              variable.   (If color support is instead provided by a color-capable curses library like [1mncurses[22m, [4mLynx[24m relies
              completely on the terminal description to determine whether color mode is possible,  and  this  flag  is  not
              needed  and  thus unavailable.)  A saved show_color=always setting found in a .lynxrc file at startup has the
              same effect.  A saved show_color=never found in .lynxrc on startup is overridden by this flag.

       [1m-connect_timeout[22m=[4mN[0m
              Sets the connection timeout, where N is given in seconds.

       [1m-cookie_file[22m=[4mFILENAME[0m
              specifies a file to use to read cookies.  If none is specified, the default value is ~/.lynx_cookies for most
              systems, but ~/cookies for MS-DOS.

       [1m-cookie_save_file[22m=[4mFILENAME[0m
              specifies a file to use to store cookies.  If none is specified, the value given by [1m-cookie_file [22mis used.

       [1m-cookies[0m
              toggles handling of Set-Cookie headers.

       [1m-core  [22mtoggles forced core dumps on fatal errors.  Turn this option off to ask [4mLynx[24m to force a core dump if a  fatal
              error occurs.

       [1m-crawl [22mwith  [1m-traversal,  [22moutput  each  page  to  a  file.  with [1m-dump[22m, format output as with [1m-traversal[22m, but to the
              standard output.

       [1m-curses_pads[0m
              toggles the use of curses ‚Äúpad‚Äù feature which supports left/right scrolling of the display.  The  feature  is
              normally  available  for  curses  configurations, but inactive.  To activate it, use the ‚Äú|‚Äù character or the
              LINEWRAP_TOGGLE command.  Toggling this option makes the feature altogether unavailable.

       [1m-debug_partial[0m
              separate incremental display stages with MessageSecs delay

       [1m-default_colors[0m
              toggles the default-colors feature which is normally set in the lynx.cfg file.

       [1m-delay [22madd DebugSecs delay after each progress-message

       [1m-display[22m=[4mDISPLAY[0m
              set the display variable for X rexec-ed programs.

       [1m-display_charset[22m=[4mMIMEname[0m
              set the charset for the terminal output.

       [1m-dont_wrap_pre[0m
              inhibit wrapping of text when [1m-dump[22m'ing and [1m-crawl[22m'ing, mark wrapped lines of <pre> in interactive session.

       [1m-dump  [22mdumps the formatted output of the default document or those specified on the command line to standard output.
              Unlike interactive mode, all documents are processed.  This can be used in the following way:

                  lynx [1m-dump [22mhttp://www.subir.com/lynx.html

              Files specified on the command line are formatted as HTML if their names end with one  of  the  standard  web
              suffixes  such  as  ‚Äú.htm‚Äù  or ‚Äú.html‚Äù.  Use the [1m-force_html [22moption to format files whose names do not follow
              this convention.

       [1m-editor[22m=[4mEDITOR[0m
              enable external editing, using the specified EDITOR.  (vi, ed, emacs, etc.)

       [1m-emacskeys[0m
              enable emacs-like key movement.

       [1m-enable_scrollback[0m
              toggles compatibility with communication programs' scrollback keys (may  be  incompatible  with  some  curses
              packages).

       [1m-error_file[22m=[4mFILE[0m
              define a file where [4mLynx[24m will report HTTP access codes.

       [1m-exec  [22menable local program execution (normally not configured).

       [1m-fileversions[0m
              include all versions of files in local VMS directory listings.

       [1m-find_leaks[0m
              toggle  memory  leak-checking.  Normally this is not compiled-into your executable, but when it is, it can be
              disabled for a session.

       [1m-force_empty_hrefless_a[0m
              force HREF-less ‚ÄúA‚Äù elements to be empty (close them as soon as they are seen).

       [1m-force_html[0m
              forces the first document to be interpreted as HTML.

              This is most useful when processing files specified on the command line which have an unrecognized suffix (or
              the suffix is associated with a non-HTML type, such as ‚Äú.txt‚Äù for plain text files).

              [4mLynx[24m recognizes these file suffixes as HTML:

                  ‚Äú.ht3‚Äù,
                  ‚Äú.htm‚Äù,
                  ‚Äú.html3‚Äù,
                  ‚Äú.html‚Äù,
                  ‚Äú.htmlx‚Äù,
                  ‚Äú.php3‚Äù,
                  ‚Äú.php‚Äù,
                  ‚Äú.phtml‚Äù,
                  ‚Äú.sht‚Äù, and
                  ‚Äú.shtml‚Äù.

       [1m-force_secure[0m
              toggles forcing of the secure flag for SSL cookies.

       [1m-forms_options[0m
              toggles whether the Options Menu is key-based or form-based.

       [1m-from  [22mtoggles transmissions of From headers.

       [1m-ftp   [22mdisable ftp access.

       [1m-get_data[0m
              properly formatted data for a [4mget[24m form are read in from the standard input and passed to the form.  Input  is
              terminated by a line that starts with ‚Äú---‚Äù.

              [4mLynx[24m  issues  an  HTTP  [1mGET[22m,  sending  the  form  to the path or URL given on the command-line and prints the
              response of the server.  If no path or URL is given, [4mLynx[24m sends the form to the start-page.

       [1m-head  [22msend a HEAD request for the mime headers.

       [1m-help  [22mprint the [4mLynx[24m command syntax usage message, and exit.

                 their occurrence in the document.

              [1mlistonly[0m
                 hidden  links are shown only on [1mL)ist [22mscreens and listings generated by [1m-dump [22mor from the [1mP)rint [22mmenu, but
                 appear separately at the end of those lists.  This is the default behavior.

              [1mignore[0m

              could display, typically 1024 (the [4mMAX_LINE[24m symbol).

       [1m-with_backspaces[0m
              emit backspaces in output if [1m-dump[22m'ing or [1m-crawl[22m'ing (like [1mman [22mdoes)

       [1m-xhtml_parsing[0m
              tells  [4mLynx[24m  that  it  can  ignore  certain tags which have no content in an XHTML 1.0 document.  For example
              ‚Äú<p/>‚Äù will be discarded.

[1mCOMMANDS[0m
       More than one key can be mapped to a given command.  Here are some of the most useful:

       ‚Ä¢   Use [1mUp arrow [22mand [1mDown arrow [22mto scroll through hypertext links.

       ‚Ä¢   [1mRight arrow [22mor [1mReturn [22mwill follow a highlighted hypertext link.

       ‚Ä¢   [1mLeft Arrow [22mor ‚Äú[1mu[22m‚Äù will retreat from a link.

       ‚Ä¢   Type ‚Äú[1mH[22m‚Äù, ‚Äú[1m?[22m‚Äù, or [1mF1 [22mfor online help and descriptions of key-stroke commands.

       ‚Ä¢   Type ‚Äú[1mk[22m‚Äù or ‚Äú[1mK[22m‚Äù for a list of the current key-stroke command mappings.

           If the same command is mapped to the same letter differing only by upper/lowercase only the lowercase mapping is
           shown.

       ‚Ä¢   Type [1mDelete [22mto view history list.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       In addition to various ‚Äústandard‚Äù environment variables such as [1mDISPLAY[22m, [1mHOME[22m, [1mPATH[22m, [1mSHELL[22m, [1mTMPDIR[22m, [1mUSER[22m, etc., [4mLynx[0m
       utilizes several [4mLynx[24m-specific environment variables, if they exist.

       Others may be created or modified by [4mLynx[24m to pass data to an external program, or  for  other  reasons.   These  are
       listed separately below.

       See also the sections on [1mSIMULATED CGI SUPPORT [22mand [1mNATIVE LANGUAGE SUPPORT[22m, below.

       Note:  Not all environment variables apply to all types of platforms supported by [4mLynx[24m, though most do.  Feedback on
       platform dependencies is solicited.

       Environment Variables Used By [4mLynx[24m:

       [1mCOLORTERM           [22mIf  set,  color  capability  for  the  terminal  is forced on at startup time.  The actual value
                           assigned to the variable is ignored.  This variable is only meaningful if [4mLynx[24m was  built  using
                           the [1mslang [22mscreen-handling library.

       [1mLYNX_CFG            [22mThis  variable,  if set, will override the default location and name of the global configuration
                           file (normally, [1mlynx.cfg[22m) that was defined by the LYNX_CFG_FILE constant in the userdefs.h file,
                           during installation.

                           See the userdefs.h file for more information.

       [1mLYNX_CFG_PATH       [22mIf set, this variable overrides the compiled-in search-list of  directories  used  to  find  the
                           configuration  files,  e.g.,  [1mlynx.cfg [22mand [1mlynx.lss[22m.  The list is delimited with ":" (or ";" for
                           Windows) like the [1mPATH [22menvironment variable.

       [1mLYNX_HELPFILE       [22mIf set, this variable overrides the compiled-in URL and configuration file URL for the [4mLynx[24m help
                           file.

       [1mLYNX_LOCALEDIR      [22mIf set, this variable overrides the compiled-in location of the locale directory which  contains
                           native language (NLS) message text.

       [1mLYNX_LSS            [22mThis  variable,  if  set, specifies the location of the default [4mLynx[24m character style sheet file.
                           [Currently only meaningful if [4mLynx[24m was built using curses color style support.]

       [1mLYNX_SAVE_SPACE     [22mThis variable, if set, will override the default path prefix for files saved  to  disk  that  is
                           defined in the [1mlynx.cfg SAVE_SPACE: [22mstatement.

                           See the [1mlynx.cfg [22mfile for more information.

       [1mLYNX_TEMP_SPACE     [22mThis  variable,  if  set,  will  override  the  default path prefix for temporary files that was
                           defined during installation, as well as any value that may be assigned to the [1mTMPDIR [22mvariable.

       [1mMAIL                [22mThis variable specifies the default inbox [4mLynx[24m will check for new  mail,  if  such  checking  is
                           enabled in the [1mlynx.cfg [22mfile.

       [1mNEWS_ORGANIZATION   [22mThis  variable,  if  set,  provides  the  string used in the [1mOrganization: [22mheader of [1mUSENET [22mnews
                           postings.  It will override the setting of the ORGANIZATION environment variable, if it is  also
                           set (and, on [1mUNIX[22m, the contents of an /etc/organization file, if present).

       [1mNNTPSERVER          [22mIf  set,  this  variable  specifies  the  default  NNTP server that will be used for [1mUSENET [22mnews
                           reading and posting with [4mLynx[24m, via news: URL's.

       [1mORGANIZATION        [22mThis variable, if set, provides the string used in  the  [1mOrganization:  [22mheader  of  [1mUSENET  [22mnews
                           postings.  On [1mUNIX[22m, it will override the contents of an /etc/organization file, if present.

       [4mPROTOCOL[24m[1m_proxy      [4m[22mLynx[24m  supports  the  use of proxy servers that can act as firewall gateways and caching servers.
                           They are preferable to the older gateway servers (see WWW_access_GATEWAY, below).

                           Each protocol used by [4mLynx[24m, (http, ftp, gopher,  etc),  can  be  mapped  separately  by  setting
                           environment  variables of the form [4mPROTOCOL[24m_proxy.  Protocols are indicated in a URI by the name
                           before ‚Äú:‚Äù, e.g., ‚Äúhttp‚Äù in ‚Äúhttp://some.server.dom:port/‚Äù for HTML.

                           Depending on your system  configuration  and  supported  protocols,  the  environment  variables
                           recognized by [4mlynx[24m may include

                               cso_proxy
                               finger_proxy
                               ftp_proxy
                               gopher_proxy
                               http_proxy
                               https_proxy
                               news_proxy
                               newspost_proxy
                               newsreply_proxy
                               nntp_proxy
                               no_proxy
                               rlogin_proxy
                               snews_proxy
                               snewspost_proxy
                               snewsreply_proxy
                               telnet_proxy
                               tn3270_proxy
                               wais_proxy

                           See [1mLynx Users Guide [22mfor additional details and examples.

       [1mRL_CLCOPY_CMD       [22mPipe the contents of the current link using this command as the target.

       [1mSSL_CERT_FILE       [22mSet to the full path and filename for your file of trusted certificates.

       [1mWWW_[4m[22maccess[24m[1m_GATEWAY  [4m[22mLynx[24m still supports use of gateway servers, with the servers specified via  ‚ÄúWWW_[4maccess[24m_GATEWAY‚Äù
                           variables  (where ‚Äú[4maccess[24m‚Äù is lower case and can be ‚Äúhttp‚Äù, ‚Äúftp‚Äù, ‚Äúgopher‚Äù or ‚Äúwais‚Äù).  However
                           most gateway servers have been discontinued.  Note that you do not include a  terminal  ‚Äú/‚Äù  for
                           gateways, but do for proxies specified by [4mPROTOCOL[24m_proxy environment variables.

                           See [1mLynx Users Guide [22mfor details.

       [1mWWW_HOME            [22mThis  variable,  if  set,  will  override  the  default startup URL specified in any of the [4mLynx[0m
                           configuration files.

       Environment Variables [1mSet [22mor [1mModified [22mBy [4mLynx[24m:

       [1mLYNX_PRINT_DATE     [22mThis variable is set by the [4mLynx[24m p(rint) function, to the [1mDate: [22mstring seen  in  the  document's
                           ‚Äú[1mInformation  about[22m‚Äù  page  (=  cmd),  if any.  It is created for use by an external program, as
                           defined in a [1mlynx.cfg PRINTER: [22mdefinition statement.  If  the  field  does  not  exist  for  the
                           document, the variable is set to a null string under [1mUNIX[22m, or ‚ÄúNo Date‚Äù under [1mVMS[22m.

       [1mLYNX_PRINT_LASTMOD  [22mThis  variable  is  set  by  the  [4mLynx[24m  p(rint)  function,  to  the [1mLast Mod: [22mstring seen in the
                           document's ‚Äú[1mInformation about[22m‚Äù page (= cmd), if any.  It is  created  for  use  by  an  external
                           program,  as  defined  in a [1mlynx.cfg PRINTER: [22mdefinition statement.  If the field does not exist
                           for the document, the variable is set to a null string under [1mUNIX[22m, or ‚ÄúNo LastMod‚Äù under [1mVMS[22m.

       [1mLYNX_PRINT_TITLE    [22mThis variable is set by the  [4mLynx[24m  p(rint)  function,  to  the  [1mLinkname:  [22mstring  seen  in  the
                           document's  ‚Äú[1mInformation  about[22m‚Äù  page  (=  cmd),  if any.  It is created for use by an external
                           program, as defined in a [1mlynx.cfg PRINTER: [22mdefinition statement.  If the field  does  not  exist
                           for the document, the variable is set to a null string under [1mUNIX[22m, or ‚ÄúNo Title‚Äù under [1mVMS[22m.

       [1mLYNX_PRINT_URL      [22mThis  variable  is  set  by the [4mLynx[24m p(rint) function, to the [1mURL: [22mstring seen in the document's
                           ‚Äú[1mInformation about[22m‚Äù page (= cmd), if any.  It is created for use  by  an  external  program,  as
                           defined  in  a  [1mlynx.cfg  PRINTER:  [22mdefinition  statement.   If the field does not exist for the
                           document, the variable is set to a null string under [1mUNIX[22m, or ‚ÄúNo URL‚Äù under [1mVMS[22m.

       [1mLYNX_TRACE          [22mIf set, causes [4mLynx[24m to write a trace file as if the [1m-trace [22moption were supplied.

       [1mLYNX_TRACE_FILE     [22mIf set, overrides the compiled-in name  of  the  trace  file,  which  is  either  [1mLynx.trace  [22mor
                           [1mLY-TRACE.LOG  [22m(the  latter  on  the  DOS/Windows  platforms).   The trace file is in either case
                           relative to the home directory.

       [1mLYNX_VERSION        [22mThis variable is always set by [4mLynx[24m, and may be used by an external program to determine  if  it
                           was invoked by [4mLynx[24m.

                           See  also  the  comments in the distribution's sample [1mmailcap [22mfile, for notes on usage in such a
                           file.

       [1mTERM                [22mNormally, this variable is used by [4mLynx[24m to determine the terminal  type  being  used  to  invoke
                           [4mLynx[24m.   If,  however,  it is unset at startup time (or has the value ‚Äúunknown‚Äù), or if the [1m-term[0m
                           command-line option is used (see [1mOPTIONS [22msection above), [4mLynx[24m will set or modify  its  value  to
                           the user specified terminal type (for the [4mLynx[24m execution environment).  Note: If set/modified by
                           [4mLynx[24m, the values of the [1mLINES [22mand/or [1mCOLUMNS [22menvironment variables may also be changed.

   [1mSimulated CGI Support[0m
       If built with the [1mcgi-links [22moption enabled, [4mLynx[24m allows access to a cgi script directly without the need for an http
       daemon.

       When  executing  such  ‚Äúlynxcgi  scripts‚Äù  (if  enabled),  the  following  variables may be set for simulating a CGI
       environment:

       [1mCONTENT_LENGTH[0m

       [1mCONTENT_TYPE[0m

       [1mDOCUMENT_ROOT[0m

       [1mHTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET[0m

       [1mHTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE[0m

       [1mHTTP_USER_AGENT[0m

       [1mPATH_INFO[0m

       [1mPATH_TRANSLATED[0m

       [1mQUERY_STRING[0m

       [1mREMOTE_ADDR[0m

       [1mREMOTE_HOST[0m

       [1mREQUEST_METHOD[0m

       [1mSERVER_SOFTWARE[0m

       Other environment variables are not inherited by the script, unless they  are  provided  via  a  LYNXCGI_ENVIRONMENT
       statement   in   the   configuration   file.   See  the  [1mlynx.cfg  [22mfile,  and  the  (draft)  CGI  1.1  Specification
       <http://Web.Golux.Com/coar/cgi/draft-coar-cgi-v11-00.txt> for the definition and usage of these variables.

       The CGI Specification, and other associated documentation, should be consulted for general information on CGI script
       programming.

   [1mNative Language Support[0m
       If configured and installed with [1mNative Language Support[22m, [4mLynx[24m will display status and other messages in your  local
       language.   See the file [1mABOUT_NLS [22min the source distribution, or at your local [1mGNU [22msite, for more information about
       internationalization.

       The following environment variables may be used to alter default settings:

       [1mLANG                [22mThis variable, if set, will override the default message language.  It is an [1mISO 639  [22mtwo-letter
                           code  identifying  the  language.  Language codes are [1mNOT [22mthe same as the country codes given in
                           [1mISO 3166[22m.

       [1mLANGUAGE            [22mThis variable, if set, will override the default message language.  This is a [1mGNU [22mextension that
                           has higher priority for setting the message catalog than [1mLANG [22mor [1mLC_ALL[22m.

       [1mLC_ALL              [22mand

       [1mLC_MESSAGES         [22mThese variables, if set, specify the notion of  native  language  formatting  style.   They  are
                           [1mPOSIXly [22mcorrect.

       [1mLINGUAS             [22mThis variable, if set prior to configuration, limits the installed languages to specific values.
                           It is a space-separated list of two-letter codes.  Currently, it is hard-coded to a wish list.

       [1mNLSPATH             [22mThis variable, if set, is used as the path prefix for message catalogs.

   [1mAcknowledgments[0m
       [4mLynx[24m  has  incorporated  code  from a variety of sources along the way.  The earliest versions of [4mLynx[24m included code
       from Earl Fogel of Computing Services at the University of  Saskatchewan,  who  implemented  HYPERREZ  in  the  Unix
       environment.   HYPERREZ  was developed by Niel Larson of Think.com and served as the model for the early versions of
       [4mLynx[24m.  Those versions also incorporated libraries from the Unix  Gopher  clients  developed  at  the  University  of
       Minnesota,  and  the later versions of [4mLynx[24m rely on the WWW client library code developed by Tim Berners-Lee and the
       WWW community.  Also a special thanks to Foteos Macrides who ported much of [4mLynx[24m to VMS and did or organized most of
       its development since the departures of Lou Montulli and Garrett Blythe from the University of Kansas in the  summer
       of  1994  through the release of v2.7.2, and to everyone on the net who has contributed to [4mLynx[24m's development either
       directly (through patches, comments or bug reports) or indirectly (through  inspiration  and  development  of  other
       systems).
